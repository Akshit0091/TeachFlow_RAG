We will not talk about it now, we will learn it in detail But I have written a general C++ code which is very basic and its function is to print Apna College on the screen So to run this code I can simply click on this run button Code will run and Apna College will be printed on the screen We can also see how much time it took to execute that code But while learning DSA, our major work will be to write code and at the end of the code, something or the other will be printed on the screen So in this way, whatever code we are writing on our laptop in Visual Studio Code All that code can be written on replit without installing anything But once again, this is just a temporary solution As a professional programmer, our priority should be to download Visual Studio Code and practice all our DAC on it But temporarily, we can also write our code on replit and run it",
