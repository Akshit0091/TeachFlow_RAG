    "text": " First of all, we have to install a code editor. Code editor is like a digital notebook. Till date, we have been reading physics, chemistry, math on a notebook. Similarly, to code, we have to write on a paper pen plus the final code we have to write it on a laptop, a digital notebook. So, this digital notebook is called a code editor. Generally, if we talk about code editors, there are many code editors available in the market. If you already have a code editor for C++, you can continue with it. I will advise you on Visual Studio Code. We will also write all the code in our course on Visual Studio Code. I am advising you on Visual Studio Code because most of the developers use Visual Studio Code to write their code. Secondly, today you may be downloading it on C++. It may be that after 6 months or 1 year, you may want to learn web development or something else. You can write all that code in Visual Studio Code. You don't have to install anything else. Apart from this, it is built by Microsoft. It is really stable. It is free to use. It is open source. We don't need to buy a license. You can simply download it. The second thing we have to install on our system is a C++ compiler. To run C++ code on a computer, it is important that our computer can recognize how C++ code looks like. C++ code has to run on an executor. That is why it is important to set up a C++ compiler in our system. We have to do both of these things positively. Whether you are on a Mac machine, Windows machine or Linux machine. First of all, we have to install Visual Studio Code. Second step is to set up a C++ compiler. As soon as we do these two steps, we will be ready to code. As a beginner, if we have a new laptop or computer, it may take some time to install the software for the first time. When we install the software for the first time, especially when we install a C++ compiler, we may have errors, bugs, and it may take some time to understand. It may take 2-4 days to install these things. Still, I would advise you to install these things. Why? Because as a programmer, installing things on your system is a basic thing. This will give us confidence as a beginner. I know how to work on my system and install software on it. If I need to install something new in the future, I will have confidence that I know how to deal with my system. Confidence is very important as a programmer. You have to do this. But because some students may have to do this, most of the students will do this on day 1. But 5%, 7%, 10% students may take 3-4 days. So, I will tell you an alternate option for those students. But this alternate option is not a permanent solution. This is a 3-4 day solution that you can use. Basically, there are many websites on which you can go and write your C++ code without downloading these things. But this is not a permanent solution. You have to see this as a temporary solution. There are many such platforms that you can use. One of these free platforms is called Replit. You can create an account on this platform if you have any issue installing these things. If you have any issue installing these things for a few days, you can use Replit for that. You have to search for things on Google and Stack Overflow. In the meantime, we don't have to worry about coding. You can use Replit for that. You don't have to install anything here. You can simply create an account and start executing things. I am stressing this again because if you are serious about your placement preparation, then you have to install these things. You have to see this as a band-aid that can help you in the starting stages. But the permanent solution that we will be learning is to download these tools on your system. You have to install and set up these tools. There are many helpful videos linked with this. You can install these things according to your machine. You can install these things according to your machine. You can install these things according to your machine.",
