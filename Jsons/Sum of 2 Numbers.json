    "text": " so the question we will solve first is called the sum of two numbers now for a problem, we generally define two things for ourselves one is what input we will get and what output we should produce like in the problem of making Maggi, we know that we will have a packet of Maggi, masala, water, we will have a gas stove and we should get cooked Maggi as output now the process of making it in between becomes our solution similarly, two numbers will come in input, we have to give sum in output the process in between is my flowchart, you can draw it and give it to me, this is your question so the flowchart to solve this question will look like this it will always start with the start block once we start, the first thing that will happen is that I need input let's see again how code works this is our code, in code generally, input is taken first and in the last we give output and exit by giving output and the work of the process in between or the work of decision making also comes in the process that is happening in the middle so we started, after that we will take input A and B if we have to sum two numbers, then we should have two numbers so in the block of parallelogram, i.e. in the input output, we will take input A and B so whatever value we have to take as input, we simply write it in front of it next what we will do, next we will process, i.e. we will do some work what work we will do, it is written in the rectangle we will take sum of A and B so we took the value of A and B and assigned it to our sum variable what are variables, we will study in detail in the next chapter but here sum is another value, another variable, in which that value is stored and then finally we have to print our sum so for print, I wrote print sum and where did it come, it came in my output block and finally, because our work is complete, we will exit so this is the complete ecological flow chart, which we have made and seen now this is the flow chart along with the flow chart, there is also an additional term, which we talked about which we call pseudocode now let's talk about what is pseudocode pseudocode is made up of two words, one is pseudo and one is code pseudo means fake and we know about code so basically pseudocode is not the real code we just try to make a flow like code by writing English in it now why is pseudocode written? pseudocode is a fake code basically and it is written because, for example, you are trying to solve a problem you know its code in C++ but there is another developer in your team, who may be coding on Python who may be coding on Java, who may be coding on JavaScript in some other language now you have to explain your logic to them so how do you explain your logic to them, because they don't know C++ so you can explain your logic to them by writing pseudocode pseudocode is basically, you have written your code in English which anyone can understand, even if they know any programming language so that's why pseudocode becomes important whenever we all, who work on different languages, are talking together because then pseudocode becomes important so in some interviews, it may happen that if there is a big algorithm and the interviewer doesn't have much time so the interviewer can tell you, that don't write the whole code for me just write the pseudocode, which means write the code in English and show it to me on a paper pen so this also happens in a few situations now how do we write pseudocode? writing pseudocode will be easier than writing flowchart, how? don't do anything, just write flowchart in English, that's what pseudocode is like, let's start writing it we write pseudocode stepwise and we don't write start generally in pseudocode we will start from here so the first step will be input a and b first line is done basically, I have told you in English, that we have to solve this problem sum of two numbers, so take input a and b what is the second thing to do? take out sum of a and b so sum is equal to a plus b so I have taken a variable, which has a plus b value so the second step is done the third step is to print sum so don't do anything, just print sum and the fourth step is exit which means pseudocode is done so my pseudocode is done basically, the thing which was written in flowchart we write it stepwise in the form of pseudocode and this is a process which doesn't matter if you are coding in C++, Python, Java or in Golang you can code in any language because this is basic English to take out sum of two numbers so this is what we call pseudocode and pseudocode and flowchart are very easy things in fact, this is your first beginner class so some of you may find it difficult but I can guarantee you as you read the second chapter or as you read the third chapter this thing will look very simple like butter",
