    "text": " After the boilerplate, we will discuss how our code runs exactly I have shown you a sample code and its output So how does the process of writing code and printing it on the output screen look internally in the computer First of all, whatever code we write, the code of C++, that is, the file I have named code.cpp We call it source code And in our computer, we have already installed our compiler Compiler is nothing but a software Just like we have more different software in the computer, the compiler is also a software Which takes our source code and performs some operations on it and gives us an executable file in the output We can imagine this executable file to be our machine code Machine code means that our computer does not understand English In fact, our computers do not even understand C++ Our computer only understands electrical signals, that is, 0 and 1 0 means that no electrical signal has come in the language of the computer And 1 means that we are getting an electrical signal So these 0s and 1s are called bits In their form, the computer performs all the data and calculations So the code of C++ that we have written in actuality, It will be converted later in the form of 0 and 1 Which the computer could understand Now the computer is not even able to understand C++ So what does the compiler do? The compiler converts our source code into an executable file And this is the file that can be executed That is, the file that we can run directly and the output can be produced Now if we are working on a Windows machine So the extension of our executable file is .exe If we are working on a Mac machine, then the extension is .out So in this way, the final executable file can have different extensions Depending upon the machine Then our executable file finally comes out of it Which is printed on our screen Now in Visual Studio Code, we can also call the screen as a terminal That is, it is our terminal or it is our output window We can give it any name So our whole process of running code is a two-step process The first step is to run the code Which we call the compile step Now this compile step is very important Because if we make a mistake in the code That is, if we make a mistake in the syntax of the code What is syntax? It is a rule So C++ has a lot of rules Like there are a lot of rules in English Like after every sentence, there should be a full stop If we have to write a lot of things, then there should be a comma in between Similarly, C++ itself is a full-fledged language Which has a lot of rules If we break those rules That is, if we bring some errors in our syntax So those errors are detected at compile time So we will get an error that you have made a mistake You fix it Only then our code will be successfully compiled And the second step after compilation The second step is basically this step In which our code is finally run Or is executed And after running it, our output is printed on the screen So now we had printed our college in the output If we want, we can write a simple thing instead of our college in the output Which is Hello World Now what does Hello World mean? Basically, there is a convention that if we learn a new programming language So we start with Hello World We can save it and we can run it from here Our code is run This time instead of our college, Hello World is printed on our screen Now whenever we write C++ code We will see semicolons again and again Semicolon is basically this symbol Which we see again and again Semicolon means full stop in C++ We also call it statement terminator Like in English, there is a statement terminator Full stop, where full stop is applied, our sentence is complete In Hindi, there is full break Where full break is applied, our sentence is complete Similarly, in C++, wherever semicolon is applied, our statement is complete So this is our first statement This is our second statement This is another statement So wherever we have to terminate statements We get semicolons there And semicolon is a part of our syntax That is, semicolon is the rule of C++ So if I don't apply this semicolon And after that I saved the code and tried to execute it Usually, Visual Studio Code will show us the error first Like this line below return of red color Expected a semicolon It is expected That is, Visual Studio Code is telling us that you have made a mistake But if I run this code, I will get an error Running and finally an error was generated The error is that in the file code.cpp In line 5, in character 24 An error has been generated That expected semicolon after expression The expression you wrote After this, a semicolon should have come This compiler is telling us So the compiler is telling us through errors What is wrong in your code And you go and fix it That's why compilation stage is also very important And finally to give the output of the code Our running, that is, the state of executing is very important",
