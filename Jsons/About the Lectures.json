    "text": " Now if we talk about lectures, we have alternate day schedule for lectures. If we have lecture on first day, then we will have holiday on second day, then we will have lecture on third day, then we will have off on fourth day and then we will have lecture on fifth day. And this off day is basically given to you to complete your assignment questions. If you want to revise anything, then you have to revise those things. So if we see, we will have two days to complete one lecture which is more than sufficient. And if you have extra time, then we need to practice as much as possible. Along with this, if we have any doubts, then we can join our community which will be our discord community. In which we will have TAs to solve our doubts. So we can ask our doubts. So our first priority should be to solve our doubts ourselves. Because a good programmer is the one who learns to solve his own problems. But in the initial stages, we may have a lot of doubts. So for that, we have to access TAs for our doubt solving. And the third thing that we will get with every lecture will be our assignment questions. You will be given assignment questions with every chapter. It is very important to do these questions. These maximum questions will be based on our classical DSA questions. That is, the general pattern of these questions will be that which is expected in interviews or coding tests. Which we should know. So don't ignore the assignment questions. We have to solve them positively before the next lecture.",
