    "text": " Next we will study about data types Data types are also very important Whenever we have to define a variable in C++ we have to tell its type that variable is going to store an integer value or floating value point something something decimal type values or it is going to store a character or true false like boolean value So what type of variable will it store? That is defined by data types Programming languages are of different types Some programming languages are such that we don't have to tell the type of variable like Python or JavaScript we don't have to tell the type of variable in these languages But C++, Java these are the languages where we have to tell the type of variable Whenever we talk about data types that is what type of data is it we have two specific types One is primitive types which we call simple types and one is non-primitive types which are in the complex types category or these are also user defined types like strings and arrays Now non-primitive types we will study later when we will cover the basics of programming in C++ after that we will study non-primitive types Now our main focus for the next coming few chapters will be on primitive types which are our simple types Now in primitive types the most used primitive types are there are few more types like void but we will study that in the functions chapter but most frequently whenever we have to define a variable of primitive type it will be of one of these types Now we will cover these types one by one First type is our integer type In integer type we can store negative integer value, positive integer value anything and for this we use the keyword like if I want to make any variable of integer type for example I want to make a variable int age so I can make it like this age is equal to 25 or I can write int marks is equal to 200 like this I have made my integer type variables If I wanted I could have made my values negative or I could have made value 0 Now integer type which takes size in memory that is equal to 4 bytes Now what is the meaning of byte in programming one byte is equal to 8 bits means in one byte there are 8 bits so 4 bytes means my integer size is equal to 32 bits and bit means 0 or 1 so if I keep 32 empty spaces and in every empty space either 0 or 1 will come so like this there can be many combinations so many different integers can be stored in my int data type so 32 bits means 1 bit means 0 or 1 so from there all data types size comes so we can remember this or it's a very general and simple thing that our integer is 32 bits means 4 bytes we can verify this how to verify if we want to print any data type size so I can print cout size of int is equal to and here we have a function we call it sizeof function so inside sizeof we can write int and then we can print what is the size of our integer let's open our terminal compile and run so we have print size of int is equal to 4 this is actually equal to 4 bytes second data type we have that is character in characters we can store single values means single character like if I want to store simple a, I want to store capital B or if I want to store a symbol like at the rate or dollar so we can store any symbol in character type and to store our characters we use single quote we don't use double quote we use single quote like I can create any character for example I can write char let's suppose I want to store grades of school and our grade is equal to a so like this we can make a variable of char data type grade in which I have stored value single a and like we have printed size of integer we can print size of character so size of char is equal to this value let's clear compile and run so this time size of char is equal to 1 byte means our character has only 8 bits in it like this 8 bits means this is combination of 8 zeros and ones which can store all our possible characters next next data type we will talk about that is our boolean data type we represent boolean with bool in boolean data type variables we store true or false values like for example our age is equal to 25 so are we an adult answer will be yes so we can make a variable we can call it bool is adult let me clear the screen and here also we give a space so I have written bool adult is equal to true so what is this I have made a boolean type variable and in the same way if we want we can print size of bool size of bool is equal to this value let's execute and run so size of bool is also 1 byte with this one more interesting thing if we want we can print our variables also if I want I can print age after age I tried to print with a space our marks and after this also with a space we try to print our grade and with a space we try to print our boolean variable is adult and here also we give an end of the line let's save it and run it so what we have printed we have this value here first we had to print age so we have age 25 then we had to print marks we have marks of magnitude 200 then we had to print grade but in this adult I have made true store so I have 1 print and if we would have made false store then we would have 0 print so whenever we have boolean variable in boolean variables the true value whenever we use true it amounts to the number 1 and false amounts to the number 0 whenever we have boolean variable in memory so in this way 8 spaces are reserved for us if there is 1 in last then it means true and when we print it will be 1 or if we have 0 in last then it means false return means value that is equal to false so these are the 3 different types apart from that our 4th type of variable is floating point floating point means if we have to store something like 99.99 with decimal values then we can use float float occupies 4 bytes of space in memory like if I want to create float variable in fact we remove these values and we remove this also so here we will write float let's suppose we want to store CGP CGP is equal to 8.9 so here size of float we will print it together so we have created floating variable by using float and we will print the size of float size of float is equal to 4 bytes next we have double floating point which we name double so in float there is a limit that till which limit with which precision precision means after point how many total numbers you can print or store in memory but it is possible that the number we want to store is a very big number so for those cases we use big data type which is double what does float do? float has only 4 bytes space it is actually similar to saying that one flat has 2 rooms and second flat has 4 rooms so in this flat there are 4 rooms and above that there is another flat which has 8 rooms so in 8 rooms if there is more space then more people can stay similarly 8 bytes space is more so more data can be stored in it so if we want we can make our CGPA or some other variable double we can store in it let's suppose the price of any item is 99.99 so in this way we can use double data type to store our floating point values now in float and double if we want to understand a difference clearly so to understand this difference we will take an example let's suppose I create 2 variables one is float variable and other is double variable in one I will store my pi value and in other also I will store my pi value I want to say this as pi2 now pi value will be 3.14265359 and by copying this same value we store it in our double now float precision is 7 numbers so float will print correct value till 7 and double precision is almost double which is 15 numbers so if float can store till 7 means 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 so what will double do double will be able to store till 15 numbers now I am going to print both this is going to be my pi1 let's say it as pi we will store pi value in it and next we will cout our pi2 this is going to be pi2 now our cout default precision means after point means after decimal how many numbers it can print that is 5 means it can print 5 numbers after decimal so if I run my code or run simply so basically my pi and pi2 values will be same so in this case float and double I am not able to see any difference but if I increase my precision means if I increase the digits after decimal how can we use that for that I have to include an extra header file which is called IOMANIP and in IOMANIP there is a function which is called set precision with this we can increase cout precision so here we will set precision let's suppose to 10 or 12 so by default cout precision is 5 we have increased it to 12 so now we can print up to 12 digits now if we save and run this same code so this time what happened pi2 as it is our entire value is printed because there was space in memory so entire value was saved but in pi1 value is a little bit wrong means value is not printed properly some initial decimal is correct means 141592 is correct and after that values are kind of approximation or incorrect value is printed so basically in float there was only this much space so according to that space numbers were saved but in double there was double space so it saved all the numbers with correct precision so difference between float and double we don't see it on small values whenever we are dealing with big data which has more decimal points then we can understand the difference between both so generally because we are on initial stages now we are on beginner stages so we don't need to take so much care as it was a little advanced thing but yes difference between both we should know that one's size is small and one's size is big so more data can be stored",
