    "text": " The next question we are going to solve is to print maximum of two numbers. Logically, if we are given any number, let's suppose 3 and 5, then which one is the largest of the two? We will compare it with this. Is 3 greater than 5? Yes or No? If it is No, then it means 5 is greater. If it is Yes, then it means 3 is greater. This is how our logical mind works, that we compare one with another. So, the work of comparison, that is, the work of checking whether this thing is true or not, we do it in the Diamond block, that is, in our decision block. For that, we have written a simple code. We will be given two numbers in the input, A and B. And simply we have to output larger of A and B. Now, for that, we will start first. After starting, first of all, we will input our two numbers, which are A and B. Then we will check, is A greater than B? Either the answer will be Yes or No. If the answer of A is greater than B is Yes, then the Yes arrow will be connected here, which we can write. If A is greater, then print the value of A. If A is not greater, then print the value of B. And as soon as any of the two is printed, the same way, exit. For example, let's suppose we have the value of A as 2, and the value of B, let's suppose, is 7. So, first we will input A and B, then we will check, is 2 greater than 7? The answer will be No. As soon as the No is printed, we will print B. B means, I have output 7 here. And then we will exit. So, 7, which was larger of two numbers, will be printed. So, logical flow works like this in problem solving. And we can convert this into pseudocode. How will we do it in pseudocode? Let's try to write the pseudocode. In pseudocode, the first step is very simple. It is to input A and B. The second step is the decision block. To write the decision block in pseudocode, we will use FLs. Before talking about FLs, there is one more point that I will tell you. Pseudocode does not have any fixed rules. Because pseudocode is just general English. Basically, in such English, you have to write your code, which everyone can understand. So, it does not have any hard and fast rules. If you use words or such things in it, which you can understand, then there is no problem. So, we can do a little bit of pseudocode according to our needs. In fact, different flowcharts can be created to solve the same problem. Because if there are multiple solutions to solve one problem, then multiple flowcharts can be created. So, there is no problem in that. At the end, our goal should be that our problem is being solved efficiently. To convert the decision block into pseudocode, we use something called FLs. So, in FLs, we write some statements and then some work. After that, we write FLs. Basically, FLs means checking the condition. Which condition is being checked here? A greater than B. If we write Is here, then we convert it into If in pseudocode. So, basically, I have to write If. If means if in English. If A greater than B, then I have to print A. If it is Yes, then A. If means the condition gave Yes. The decision block gave Yes. So, here we will print A. We give some space to this work. We give space because we want to represent that if this thing gives Yes, then this work will be done. That's why we give space to it. If it gives Yes, then this work will be done. It's not that this work will be done continuously. If it gives No, then this work will be done. So, because my work depends on this condition, that's why I have given a small space here. This space is called indentation in programming. Indentation is not that important in C++. It is important to see the code but it is important in pseudocode. In fact, there are some programming languages where everything depends on indentation. For example, Python is a programming language where indentation is very important. But it is not that important in C++. In fact, I personally like C++ because of that. So, we have to give proper spacing by giving some space. In the case of Else, we will write that Else means if the condition gives No. Whatever we have written here, if it gives Yes, then write its work here. If it gives No, then write its work here. So, we will write Else, print B. This whole thing will become our step 2. This whole thing will become our step 2. This whole thing and this whole thing I have counted as my step 2. Finally, whatever was to be printed will be done and we will exit from here. So, whenever we have to write the decision block, we write it in the form of If Else. We write If our decision, our question whose answer should be Yes or No. If it is Yes, then we will write Else tells us that if No has come, then whatever work has to be done, we will write it here with space. So, this whole thing is considered as a single step in Pseudo Code. So, in this way, logically we write our max of two numbers in the form of Pseudo Code.",
