    "text": " next we will do one more question in which we are going to print the average marks means we have to take input of 3 subjects one subject can be science one can be english and one can be math we have to take input of 3 subjects and then we have to give average of these 3 subjects now what is the average of 3 values average of 3 values is value 1 plus value 2 plus value 3 all values divided by 3 and in C++ the symbol of divide is equal to slash slash is used to divide the numbers in C++ and to multiply we use the symbol of asterisk so in this way we can calculate the average of 3 values and can print it so first of all we will define our 3 variables let's define our 3 variables first of all will be my english marks second will be science marks and similarly math marks now let's do cout here enter english marks c in will be our english marks let's copy this here we will enter our science marks and here we will enter our math marks when we will have marks of all 3 subjects after that we will take one more int value which we will call average average is going to be in bracket we will add our science marks and math marks in english marks and then we will divide the whole sum with 3 so our average marks are here and finally we will print our average marks average marks equals average with end line so this is our complete code which we have completed this is our entire program in which we will have marks of 3 subjects now let me tell you one more interesting thing related to the divide in C++ in C++ when we divide integer value with integer value so answer always comes as integer what does it mean? it means that if we divide 5 with 2 so answer comes as 2.5 in math but here answer will not come as 2.5, here answer will come as 2 means first 2.5 will be calculated and then the value after point will be cut and only the initial integer will be left if answer would have been 2.999 still answer would have printed only 2 so let's execute it once for example here I compiled my code and run it let's suppose english marks are 95 our science marks are 98 and math marks are 96 so what is the answer? average marks are 96 but answer should have been 96.33 that 0.33 was deducted from here so what we can do is we can make all these marks float type from the beginning because we are already dealing with decimal values so here our average will also be float type so if we run it again english marks are 95 again science marks are 98 and math marks are 96 so what is the answer? we got the correct value in average marks with our decimal digits 96.3333 so if we want our result with precision then we have to use correct data type while doing our calculations",
