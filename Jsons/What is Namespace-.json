    "text": " Now we are going to talk about namespace Namespace basically helps us in naming conflicts What does it mean? Whenever we are writing a C++ code then it is possible that in a single code or a single program we are using multiple libraries So it is possible that in this code, one library is A second library is B third library is C and by including all these libraries we are going to create a good code Now in every library there can be some functions there can be some objects there is a separate code written in each library Now it is possible that in this A library there is a function called draw which draws a circle for me Similarly, in this library B there is another function called draw which draws a square for me So here I will have a square draw and here I will have a circle draw Now if I include both these libraries in my code and I try to use my draw function anywhere then my code will get confused my compiler will get confused that should I use the A draw or should I use the B draw means compiler will not understand that it has to draw a circle or it has to draw a rectangle or a square So this is a confusing state which leads to a conflict conflict means that two people have a conflict that whose words should be believed So to avoid these conflicts we use namespaces So in C++ our standard namespace is called STD STD means standard means C++ standard namespace Now we can understand namespace in this way For example, you went to buy a plot or a flat Now a flat or a plot on the ground that is a physical entity In actual, in real life any plot exists but government doesn't know whose flat is which whose plot is which So what does the government do? It maintains a separate registry means government has a registry that this plot belongs to this person this flat belongs to this person this farmhouse belongs to this person Now this physical thing it exists in actual but where is their registry? Their registry is here with the government So in the same way our Cout from which we were getting the output printed or there are other functions like Cin this Cout function this Cin function these functions are created in this header file named Iostream but where are their names registered? Their names are registered in this namespace named STD I will repeat this example Like actual plot is separate but we have to get its registry done separately to the government So in the same way functions like Cout and Cin are actually written in our header file in Iostream but the registry of their names we have to do it separately in our STD namespace So if I have to use Cout anywhere then to tell which namespace is Cout I have to write STD colon colon Cout So in this way I will use my Cout Now what is Cout? We did not read it in detail but we would have got this basic idea that by using Cout we are printing things on the screen things are coming with output So whenever I have to use this Cout I have to use STD colon colon Like if I talk about my code So in my code we will remove these old things Here I can write STD colon colon Cout and after that I can print anything For example I have printed my college here saved it and will run it so my whole code will run well my college will be printed and there will be no error So what is the meaning of STD colon colon? So here I am telling you that Cout's registry exists in the namespace STD So if tomorrow in this program I use any other library in which another Cout exists then my code will know that I don't want to use another Cout I want to use this Cout which comes in my STD namespace So in the same way in C++ all the standard classes, objects, functions or other things, variables even they are all registered in the standard namespace of C++ whose name is STD If tomorrow I start using any other namespace like ABC So if I want to use ABC's Cout then I can write ABC But because we will always use C++ namespace to learn DSA then we need to write STD And now comes your most important question that if we needed to write STD then even after removing it why is our whole code running successfully? Even after removing it our whole code is executing successfully So there is no error in this There is no error in this because we have written this line using namespace STD So instead of writing STD colon colon in front of everything what we can do we can write a single line on our code using namespace STD which will tell the compiler that all the functions, classes, objects and all the things that are being used which namespace are they registered in are coming from STD So we don't need to write STD again and again We can tell our whole code in one single line which namespace we want to use in our whole code We can use multiple namespaces If we bring an external library in which our namespace name is ABC then we can use two namespaces But in our whole course because while doing DSA we needed namespaces other than STD then we are going to use this standard namespace There are two words with this which we will see in programming One word is define and one word is declare Declare means just to tell and define means how things are working in detail and how to define its layout So basically how does Cout work exactly The definition of it which we have defined we have defined it in Iostream So the definition of Cout or the work of defining it is in our header file But the declaration of Cout Declaration means to tell that Cout also exists Where is it? It is in our namespace It is in our STD It is basically like where does a plot physically exist That is its definition But its registry i.e. telling the government about that plot that will be its declaration that we have declared that this plot exists and it is ours or this flat exists and it is ours So these are the two keywords which we will see in programming We should know the difference between them Define means actual thing and declare means just to tell about that thing",
