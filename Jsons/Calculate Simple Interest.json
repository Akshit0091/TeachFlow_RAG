    "text": " In the next question, we are going to create flowchart and pseudocode to calculate the simple interest Simple interest is something that we have learnt in basic math in our 6th to 8th grade How do we calculate simple interest? Basically, we have 3 values in input Principle, Rate and Time which we call PRT and when we multiply these 3 values and divide it by 100 then we get the formula of simple interest Now, there might be students among us who don't know the formula of simple interest because we don't use the formula of simple interest in 11th and 12th grade so we might have forgotten it There is nothing to worry about that In coding, your logic is tested Your math or interest formulas are not tested It is possible that you might be asked compound interest in a question that write a small program which can calculate it Now, it is possible that we don't know the formula of compound interest so there is nothing to worry about that because if any good interviewer is sitting in front of you then you can ask him the formula because your job is not to write the formula, you are not a mathematician you are a programmer If you are given a formula, then your job is to convert it into code This formula is very easy but if you don't know it, then you can ask it to your interviewer So, we have to output this formula The process is simple that we have to start First of all, we will take input of all 3 values So, we will take input of PRT in the parallelogram After that, we have to do calculation How to calculate simple interest in calculation? P x R x T The sign of multiplication is in programming The sign of star is on our keyboard We call it asterisk We call it asterisk We can use asterisk to multiply things We use slash for divide 100 I have written SI for simple interest Similarly, we will print simple interest in my output block Finally, we will exit Now, let's try to write a pseudocode for this As I told you, because we have already seen one pseudocode so you can try this pseudocode by yourself Pause the lecture Try to write a pseudocode by yourself and then come and see the solution So, the first step for pseudocode We can skip the start We will write 3 values P, R, and T The second step will be Calculate simple interest as P x R x T divided by 100 The third step will be Print your simple interest It will be in the output Print means output We are using print because we are going to output on the screen So, we call it as print The fourth step will be exit So, this is the pseudocode to calculate simple interest",
