    "text": " Hi everyone, my name is Shraddha Khapra and I will be your teacher for the batch. You can find me on LinkedIn or on YouTube. I am an ex-Microsoft software engineer. I have also interned in Microsoft as a software engineer. I was also a machine learning intern at DRDO. And I was also an invitee for the Google SPS program for my batch. I have been teaching coding to students for almost 4 years now. And there are a lot of my students who are currently working at good product based companies. Be it a man company, a startup or a mid-sized company. So in this course, we will be studying C++ and DSA in detail. So whenever we talk about studying DSA, I see it as a 3 step process. The first important process is to learn the language. That is, we should have a strong command on C++ language. In which generally it takes us 10-15 days. So in the 7 chapters of our starting, we will be deep diving and focusing on C++ as a language. After that, the second step is to learn data structures and algorithms. So in the remaining batch time, we will be studying different algorithms and data structures of DSA. And the third step, which is the most crucial step, is to practice, practice and practice. So that is why, with every chapter, we will be solving our practice questions in the class or in the lecture. Along with every chapter, we will have assignment questions to practice more questions. So that the more we practice, the more our logic will become strong in programming. Now in this journey, there is one more thing that we have to make our best friend. Many times as a programmer or as a human being, we are very scared of errors and problems in life. And we don't like problems. But as a software engineer, problems, errors, exceptions are our best friends. Because whenever you have a problem or an error in the code, that is your opportunity to learn a lot. Because problems and errors are our best friends in software engineering and they teach us a lot. As a software engineer or as a programmer, our job is to solve problems. So the more problems we face, the more we will solve them. And the more we will become a better software engineer and a better coder. So whenever there are problems, errors, exceptions, don't worry about them. The solution to everything is available on the internet. The best thing we can do is to simply search for any error or problem on Google search. And generally, the top results we get are from a website called Stack Overflow. On which we will get the solutions to 95-99% of our problems. Because before us, there are already millions of people who have studied programming. So our maximum problems will be such that someone has already faced. So we will have the solution for it. So those solutions are readily available on the internet. So we can use them. Otherwise, we will have a doubt community in which we will have access to it. So that we can ask our problems there. But in programming, this mindset should always be made from the beginning. That I have to become a good problem solver, only then I will be able to become a good software engineer. For that, errors and problems are my best friends. And as a good programmer, I should definitely know how to solve my own problems. Along with this, I see coding as a journey that we generally understand backwards. That is, like we start exercising in the beginning. So we don't feel much for the first 2-4 days. We start feeling like this after 1 month, 2 months, 3 months. Okay, our exercising is actually bringing some results. So it is the same with coding and programming. We will not feel anything different on the first day that we have learned a lot of logic today. But yes, definitely after 1 month, 15 days, 2 months. You will feel a big change in your logical thinking process. So coding is something that we have to do consistently, every day. But we will not feel that change every day. We will feel that change by looking backwards. That is, a month ago, my logic has become so strong. After a month, my logic has become stronger. Now in the third month, my logic has become very strong. So in this way, we have to see programming as a journey. Which is a journey of many months, learning from the day. In which we will be practicing a lot of things. We will be learning new things, we will be implementing them. So in this journey of programming, two things are most important. The first is self-belief. Whatever our college is, whatever our branch is, whatever degree we are coming from. Never think that programming is something that only a few people can do. Which is only made for geniuses. Programmers, software engineers, who are still sitting in the top companies. They are students like us, who started at a small level. And then with consistent steps, they will get better with time. So you can definitely do it, irrespective of your background. We always have to keep this self-belief in us. It is not necessary to become a good programmer or to crack a good company. It is necessary to have our IIT from Bombay. Or it is necessary to have a born genius. Programming is a skill that anyone can learn by putting in time and effort. And the second thing that we should have is discipline. We have to sit daily with consistency and complete the lectures. We have to complete the assignment questions. We have to practice and revise as much as possible. We have to try to make our own notes. If we stay consistent in this journey, then discipline will automatically become ours. And the more disciplined you are, the more we will have a good grip on programming. It is not important to sit for 8 hours or 12 hours to code. It is important to sit and code for 2 hours, 3 hours or 4 hours daily. So that the logic building process in our mind is consistently formed. So in the next 4 months, we are going to learn a lot of things. So we have to tackle this journey with self-belief and discipline. And our entire effort will be to provide you all the resources and guidance. Which is probably available to a top student of a tier 1 college's computer science branch. So you will not feel a shortage of guidance, mentorship and resources from our side. You just have to keep your hard work and efforts 100%. So let's start with our programming journey.",
