    "text": " Next we are going to talk about a very important topic which we call variables in programming Now what are variables? Variables are such things which you must have already studied in your Maths In Maths, for example, we are given a rectangle whose one side is equal to A and the other side is equal to B and if I have to calculate the perimeter of this rectangle then we had a formula 2 multiplied by A plus B and similarly if I have to calculate the area of any rectangle then in Maths we used to write A multiplied by B so this used to be our area Now the formula which we have written what difference does it make to us what is the value of A or what is the value of B In A, it is possible that A's value is 10 in today's date and B's value is 5 in today's date Similarly, in the future, it is possible that A's value gets updated to 20 and B's value gets updated to 15 So A and B are such things whose value can change but we have given a name to those values A and B So we call this A and B in the language of programming or Maths as variables Variables means the thing which can change So variables are such things whose value can be changed but we have given a name to it We are saying it It can have a value of 10, 20 or 50 Similarly, we can create variables in programming Variables are nothing We can imagine a variable as a box or a container Like there are many containers in our kitchen Some have salt in it, some have sugar Similarly, there is a container in which we will write a value This value can be anything This value can be 10 And I have given a name to this container I have given a name to this container A So what is this A? It will be the name of my variable So in the formula of our perimeter A and B will be our variables And this 2, we call it literal in programming Literal are those values which mean literally the same Like 2 means 2 only 2 means 5, 2 means 20 Similarly, if I write a character A So A character means A character only A character means it will be E by changing tomorrow Variables can change their value The value of A and B can be different But the value of 2 will always be 2 The value of 5 will always be 5 So this difference is between variables and literals Now one more important thing In our programming, in C++, all the variables have names Like if I have named the variable A If I have named the variable B If I have named it C, or any other name Whatever are the names of our variables These names are basically called identifiers So what is a variable name? A variable name is also an identifier Identifier basically means It is a way of identifying something We can understand it like this Whether I create a variable in my C++ code Maybe in the next coming chapters I create a function Maybe when we read object-oriented programming in C++ Then we create objects, we create classes We can create a lot of things Right now, we are going to create variables Because we are starting programming But tomorrow we will create a lot of things And everything needs a different name For example, the name of a function is main So every function has different names Every object has a different name Every variable has a different name Every class has a different name So all these names of things We put all these names in the category of identifiers We call them identifiers Because what is the job of a name? The job of a name is to identify any person or anything If I say pencil, then I am talking about the pencil Or if I say mouse, then I am talking about the mouse So in programming, identifier means That we are giving a name to something So the names of variables are also identifiers And here I will give you a pro tip in programming The pro tip is that whenever we are writing a code Always keep the name of the variable, i.e. the name of the identifier We have to keep it meaningful Meaningful means that only by looking at the variable We can understand what value will be stored in it Like x, y, a, b, c Generally, we give all the variables the same name in math But in programming, we have to give a meaningful name If I am storing the age of a person Because we have to store data in the code And we use our variables to store data So if I am storing the age of a person Then I will give the variable the name age If I am storing someone's name Then I will give him the name name If I am storing someone's CGPA Then I will give him the name CGPA You should understand by reading the name of the variable What value is written in this variable This is such a pro tip that you are coding yourself So it will help you understand your code yourself If you are looking at your code again after two months And the second case will help you a lot in interviews Because if the name of your variable is meaningful Then it will impress your interviewer first That this person knows programming He understands that if I am going to a company Then I don't have to understand it alone I have to understand 10 more people of the company Because tomorrow it may be that a junior of mine comes Who is trying to understand that code So the code should be written in such a way That its meaning is understood very clearly So it is a good sign of a programmer So always remember this interview tip Now we have talked about the overview How variables are Now let's talk about how variables exist in memory Now I understood that the job of a variable is To store any data But where is that data being stored? That data is stored in the memory of the computer And specifically speaking It is stored in the RAM of the computer RAM we had read in childhood Random Access Memory Which is volatile That is, once you close your computer Then all the data will disappear in the RAM That's why we will create all the variables in our code If we close the code Then our variables will also disappear from memory They don't stay forever But if we rerun the code again If we re-execute Then they will come back in the RAM Now how do variables work? We can assume the memory of the computer As land What is the memory of the computer? There is a lot of land And what is on the land? There are a lot of plots This is my first plot This is my second plot This is my third plot This is my fourth plot And every plot has a different size It is possible that the size of this plot is 1 acre The size of this plot can be 4 acres The size of this plot can be 8 acres So in this way, every plot has a different size So if I create a variable To create a variable, we have to write a command in C++ For example, I wrote int a is equal to 10 This is my first line And I wrote int b is equal to 5 Here I created my variable 1 Here I created my variable 2 This line is used to create a variable Here a is the name of my variable 10 is its value And int is the type of that variable We will study about types in detail But type basically tells us what value can be added to a variable I know what is 10, it is my integer value So I gave it a type of int Similarly, b also has an integer value So I gave it a type of int So this line is saying that create a variable for me With the name a, in which I have to store the value of 10 Now, there are different plots on the land So what I can do is I can take any plot and create a house on it I can give any name to my house Let's suppose I gave it the name Shraddha Sadan I can give it any name I gave it the name Shraddha Bhavan So that name is actually the name of a variable So there is a place, but what name did I give to that place? If I gave it the name Shraddha Bhavan, it will become the name of my variable Similarly, here a place is taken in the memory And on that place, this value 10 is stored So basically, the person who is living in that house, this value is 10 10 values are living in that house And the name of that house is a So in this way, variables are actually created in the memory Similarly, if I wrote int b is equal to 5 So a plot is taken in the memory Similarly, the actual plots are not that big They are very small in size So that place is taken in the memory And a name is given to that place So what is the name given to the place? The name is given to the place b And who is living in this house? What value is stored in this memory location? The actual value stored in the memory location is 5 Tomorrow, we can change the value of the variable For example, if I wrote b is equal to 50 In this way So 5 will be removed from this memory location And 50 will be stored here Or tomorrow I can make any other variable If I wrote int age is equal to 25 Let's suppose I wrote this line So in my memory, a new variable will be created With the name age What value will be stored in it? The value stored in it will be 25 So in C++, we create our variables in this way And actually in the memory They are stored in this way internally Now let's try to create some variables in our code I can write int a is equal to 10 I can write int b is equal to 5 In this way, I have created two variables Now if I want to print their value Then I can simply write cout Let's suppose I wrote a In this way, I wrote end line here In this way, I wrote cout a end line So what will be printed in this case? As soon as we run this code Let me open my terminal window To open the terminal, we can go to this symbol We will go to terminal First of all, we will compile our code Then we will run it So what is printed? I have a printed But what do I want? I want 10 I want to print this 10 value Which is inside my variable So whenever we want to print the value of a variable We don't write it in double quotes Instead of writing it in double quotes What we will do? We will write it without any quote Here we will write our value without any quote And let's try to compile it And run again So what is printed this time? This time 10 is printed on the screen Similarly, if we want, we can print b as well That is, we write here a is equal to And in the same way We will write b is equal to Let's save it So we have a is equal to 10 Okay, here we had to print the value of b So once again a is equal to 10 And my b is equal to 5 We got it printed Now, one more interesting thing about c++ Actually, this equal to sign Is a special symbol Like how do we use equal to in math? If I write a is equal to b in math It means that the value of a and b are the same But it doesn't mean that in c++ In c++, a is equal to b means That I am putting the value of b in a That is, if I write a is equal to 10 It means that the value of 10 is stored in a So this equal to is actually We call it an assignment operator We will study operators in detail later But it is called an assignment operator Which assigns a value That is, it gives a value to someone So, the value of 10 is stored in a Now, we can create our variables without assignment Like here Let's remove this line Like, let's suppose I didn't write a is equal to 10 I only wrote int a This is also a valid way to create a variable But when we create our variable in this way So, we didn't give any value to a This means that in c++, a doesn't store 0 A stores a garbage value That means, random numbers will be stored in a And no one can predict what that number will be That number can be anything It is possible that in your system, that number is printed differently And in my system, that number is printed differently Like, if I try to compile and run my code So, that number is printed in this way Any number can be in your system This number is a garbage value which is not a valid value But it is possible that if I assign a a good value tomorrow Like, I assigned a a value of 10 Then, the value of a will change tomorrow So, let's save it And let's compile it and run it So, this time, the value of a is 10 So, if we simply create any variable in our code But we don't assign any value to it So, by default, in c++, a garbage value is stored in that variable",
