    "text": " Hi everyone, I hope you have installed Visual Studio Code on your Mac, Windows or Linux system. Once we install VS Code, we can click on the icon and open it. After opening, the first thing we have to do is to install two extensions. In VS Code, the extension option is at the bottom of the left panel. We will click on this option and search for our first extension which is C-C++. This is the official extension from Microsoft which has 62 million downloads. First of all, we have to install this. We can click on the install button. The second extension we are installing is Code Runner. You will get 25 million installs for Code Runner. We have to install this too. As soon as we install, we will see these two extensions in our installed panel. Now if we want to write a code for C++ on Visual Studio Code, we can write a sample code and test it. Before writing the sample code, we will click on the icon at the top which is basically our files and folder icon. We can also call it our files and folder or our explorer icon. When we click on it, we will get the option of open folder. We can open a folder. Then Visual Studio Code will give us the option to open any of the existing folders in our computer. Now instead of existing folder, we will create a new folder for ourselves. We can click on the new folder option. If you are on Windows, you can also create a new folder for yourself. We can give any name to our folder and we will be writing our C++ code in this folder. We will create this folder and open it. As soon as the folder opens, we will get some options like this. We will click on yes. If a welcome window has opened for us, we can close it. We will get a lot of options on the side of the folder name to create subfolders or files in the folder. The first icon is to create a new file. We can click on this icon and a new file will be created for us and we have to give a name to this file. We can give any name to our file. We can give it ABC.cpp, we can give it First Code, First Class.cpp. I am going to give it the name Code.cpp. Code is the name of this file and .cpp is the extension of this file which tells us that this is going to be a C++ file. As soon as we press enter, a C++ file will be created for us and we can write our C++ code in this file. If any windows opens for us, we can cross them. Now we are going to write a very small sample code in Visual Studio Code. So let's write our first C++ code. Also, if you are testing with me, then one thing you have to remember. C++ is a case sensitive language. It means that if anything in C++ is written in capital, then you have to write it in capital. If anything is written in small, then you have to write it in small. So when we follow everything dot by dot, then there will be no error in our code. But if we make anything capital or make anything small, then there can be an error in our code and it may not run. But there is no need to worry in such a situation. Whatever error is coming, it will be in English. We have to try to understand it, try to google it, and try to solve it. Let's try to write our first code. Hash include iostream using namespace std int main cout hello world run 0 Now, the code we have written now, we will not understand it at all. We will not understand its meaning either. But there is no need to worry about this code. By the way, this is a very simple C++ code. We will understand each line and word of this code in detail in our next chapter when we start coding. For now, you don't need to see its exact meaning. To run our code, there will be many icons on the right side of our visual studio code. We can use this icon to run our code. As soon as we open it, we will have three options. We have to choose our run code option. And as soon as we click on it, our code will run. Code run means that whatever we had to print or do, it will be done. We want to print hello world in this code. So our output window opens from below and hello world is printed on it. In fact, how long did it take to execute this code? It is also printed which is 2.133 seconds. This is the first way to run your code in visual studio code. Apart from this, there is one more way which is the terminal way. We can run our code by going to the terminal option and entering this window. We will learn that way in our next class when we start writing C++ code. But I hope that we have completed our visual studio code installation. We have also written a small C++ code on it and tested it. So for now, this is more than enough. Now we will first read about pseudocode and flowcharts in the first chapter. And after that, we will start our actual programming journey from the second chapter with variables and data types.",
